# Active Directory Home Lab

**Quick TLDR:** Built a small Active Directory lab with **1 Windows Server 2019** and **1 Windows 10 client**, created a domain, managed users and groups, and used an **automated bulk user creation script with PowerShell**.

This lab was designed to get hands-on experience with Active Directory, including domain setup, user management, and client authentication.

## What I Did
- Installed **Windows Server 2019** and promoted it to a **Domain Controller**
- Created a domain: `mydomain.com`
- Added **Organizational Units (OUs)** and groups
- Ran a **PowerShell script** to generate ~1,000 random user accounts
- Set up a **Windows 10 VM client** and joined it to the domain
- Logged in as domain users to test authentication
